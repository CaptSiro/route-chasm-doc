\section{Use cases}\label{sec:use_cases}
The goal, of this section, is to clarify how developers interact with the framework and how the core features solves real-world problems.

\subsection{Developer Personas}\label{subsec:use_cases-developer_personas}
Developers are sorted into categories by their expertise.
For each category different developer persona is created and analyzed.

\subsubsection{DP1: Beginner Web Developer}
While the system is not designed for beginner web developers it is definitely a step up from the relatively low-level API
that PHP provides out of the box.
RouteChasm provides certain features that tailor to fast deployment of prototype websites and these features may be used
by beginner developer for easier implementation of less robust system.
Some of these features my include: imperative route declaration, simple database model, and intuitive content rendering.
These concepts are easy to learn and are the essential tools for creating any full-stack web solution.
The beginner developer benefits from conventional architecture for each layer of abstraction.

\subsubsection{DP2: Intermediate and Expert Web Developers}
The target audience of RouteChasm are developers who are experienced in full-stack development with and without frameworks,
because RouteChasm adds a lot of features that build upon concepts from low-level technologies.
Developers deeply familiar with PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are going to have the leanest learning curve with the framework.
The developer persona expects predictable architecture, reusable components, and the ability to customize default behavior
and RouteChasm can satisfy all these claims.

\subsubsection{DP3: Tooling and Library Developer}
RouteChasm's aim to have all the systems easily extensible generates endless possibilities for tools and libraries to be
created for the framework.
Developers can create custom content rendering views.
Libraries can access and work with application database or external database or define sandboxed routing trees.
System administrators can download package of third party editor components.

\subsection{Primary Use Cases}\label{subsec:use_cases-primary_use_cases}
The primary use cases of RouteChasm focus on simplifying web development and removing unnecessary boilerplate.

\subsubsection{UC1: Define a Database Table}
A developer defines a new database table, after which RouteChasm automatically provides table querying operations (first, all).
From the defined database table schema RouteChasm can create automatic grid template or simple form for creating or updating
models of the table.
RouteChasm's admin package is able to infer logic for simple Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with web-based UI\@.

\subsubsection{UC2: Create a Webpage Using the Component-Based Editor}
A developer constructs or edits a web-page by assembling components such as simple text views, headers, lists,
or custom components.
The editor stores metadata required for rendering and persists the final structure on the server.
If desired component is not implemented it can be easily created with AI generation component.

\subsubsection{UC3: Render Content Through a Unified Abstraction Layer}
A developer renders content using RouteChasm's abstraction layer that unifies routing, templates, database access, and component metadata.
This reduces the need for manual wiring between layers while providing the benefits of decoupled logic for each layer.
